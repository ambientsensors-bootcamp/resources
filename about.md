# Ambient Sensors Bootcamp

## About 
Ambient Sensors Bootcamp is an unpaid software engineering internship opportunity for future, current, and former students in computer science.  

The program has been designed and created by [Nilab Mousa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nilabmm/) with the goal of providing industry experience to computer science students, especially to female students, and helping them transition to industry jobs. In addition to working on interesting projects, bootcamp participants get a chance to interact with engineers from other software companies during the "Industry Speaker" sessions. Practicing technical interviews is another important part of the experience at the bootcamp.   
  
[Ambient Sensors](http://www.ambientsensors.com/) oversees the projects and offer their expertise and talent of their full-time engineers and HR department. [Robert Davidson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertdavidson/) and his team has generously provided their office and conference room to be used for the bootcamp on weekends.
